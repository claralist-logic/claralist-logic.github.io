  <h2>Clara Elizabeth List</h2>
</header>
<article>
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>My name is Clara and I am a PhD student in the <i>Mathematische Logik und interdisziplinäre 
  Anwendung der Logik</i> group at the Universität Hamburg. I mainly work in the intersection of Set Theory 
  and Modal Logic and am under the supervision of Joel David Hamkins (University of Notre Dame) and Benedikt Löwe (Universität Hamburg, University of Cambridge).</p>

<p>I am currently looking at the first-order modal logic of forcing. 
  That is, I am trying to characterise the first-order modal assertions that are 
  valid under the forcing interpretation in models of ZFC. 
  Here, &#x25a1;&phi; is interpreted as <i><q>in every forcing extension &phi;</q></i> 
  and &#x25c7;&phi; as <i><q>in some forcing extension &phi;</q></i>. 
  The propositional analogue of this question was first investigated by Hamkins and Löwe in <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2008-360-04/S0002-9947-07-04297-3/S0002-9947-07-04297-3.pdf"> this paper</a>. </p>

<p>I am also interested in the original texts produced by logicians during the early development of set theory. 
  In particular, I am currently looking at the writings of Georg Cantor, 
  who is considered to be the founder of set theory. 
  These were mainly written in German and I am translating several of his papers into English.</p>

<p>I am originally from Graz, Austria and moved to the UK in 2015 to begin my studies in mathematics. 
  In 2019 I obtained my BSc in Pure Mathematics from Imperial College London, 
  and in 2020 I graduated from the University of Oxford with an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science. 
  My Master’s dissertation was titled “Infinitary logic and infinite time Turing machines” 
  and was supervised by Joel David Hamkins. 
  In 2021 I completed the Logic Year at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation in Amsterdam, 
  and in 2022 I started my PhD at the Universität Hamburg. </p>

<p>Send me an email if you want to chat about set theory 
  or some other area of logic — my interests are widely spread within logic, 
  so I’m sure there will be some sort of overlap in interests! 
  Feel free to also contact me if you are thinking of doing a bachelor's/master's/PhD in mathematics 
  (or some other area related to logic) and have any questions you want to discuss. </p>

<p>My email address is <i>first.middle.last</i>@uni-hamburg.de, where you replace <i>first/middle/last</i> with my first/middle/last name as seen in the header of this website. </p>
